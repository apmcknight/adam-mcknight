I’m a web developer and designer based in Lebanon, Ohio. I’ve been building and managing Technology Operations for over 6 years! I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build effective and fast web apps that provide a stage for what my clients have to sale.

I decided to try something new and build my personal site using Gatsby, mdx, and React JS.

**Stack for mcknight.netlify.app:**

* HTML, CSS, and React JS for the frontend,
* Gatsby, and mdx for the static rendering,
* Netlify and GitHub for hosting.

Inspired by the post made by Wes Boss, I decided to create a /uses page. The following is a curated list of the Hardware, Software, Tools, and EDC that I use to get my job done. I use both tools for Software Development and Network Engineering.

* **VPN:** Right now, I'm using my own VPN Config that's running behind my own network through a UniFi Security Gateway and RP.
* **Notes:** Notion, hands down.

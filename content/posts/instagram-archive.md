> Introduction

From time-to-time, the brand Adam McKnight may choose to Archive entire social media accounts for Historical Record, meaning that we may download all photographs posted to the account, posts and other media attached and store them for history. When we archive an account, or posts on an account it is marked within the description: "Account and Posts may be archived for Historical Record."

> Decision to Archive @clobyadam Instagram

We reached the decision to achieve the Instagram handle @clobyadam, once speaking with Adam and coming to the conclusion of archiving the account. We have future plans for this handle, and wanted to archive the account before making new posts.

After which I disconnect my phone from its charger, and start the day off with scrolling through overnight Notifications, E-Mails, and Instagram Posts. After reviewing the accounts for the day, I decide to finally set-foot out of bed. Typically, I take a shower and get dressed before heading down stairs — So I'll spare you that part of my day. Once I'm all fresh, I typically go into the kitchen and start a cup of coffee in my Nespresso. <em>As a Side Note: Nespresso, IMO is the best coffee you can have!)</em> After I've had my cup of coffee, I typically start working on my side-project. Which right now is the my Shop, right here on my site! You can go check it out, by clicking: Shop in the top nav.",

If I'm not in a meeting, or OOO, I'll typically try to work through 5–10 development tickets a day, if I'm lucky; Fixing bugs, adjusting code, etc. 90% of what I do is fix other peoples issues, which is kind of the part I love about what I get to do everyday! I enjoy taking something broken, and fixing it to its former glory — or recreating it all together. After getting my hard days work in, I close my computer, plug my phone in and un-plug for the rest of the evening. Unwinding with some Netflix or maybe by catching a F.C. Cincinnati or Blue Jackets game! Around 10p, I head upstaris and climb into my cozy bed; Turn the lights off and go to sleep to start this whole process again the next day!",

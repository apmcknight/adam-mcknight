  "description": "<p></p><h2>TL;DR</h2><p></p><p>I’m a web developer and designer based in Lebanon, Ohio. I’ve been building and managing Technology Operations for over 6 years! I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build effective and fast web apps that provide a stage for what my clients have to sale.</p><p>Currently my tech stack is:</p><ul><li><p>HTML, CSS, and React JS for the front end.</p></li><li><p>Ubuntu, Docker, Node, MySQL, and a custom build of Ghost CMS for the backend.</p></li></ul><p></p><p></p><h2>The Juicy Details:</h2><p></p><p>My passion for computers started when I was a little kid, and grew from there. In 2013 I started volunteering at my Church recording and editing videos, which over the years led to designing graphics. This urge to be creative then led to me taking a pivotal step, by attending Butler Tech, D. Russel Lee during my Junior and Senior years of High School. In 2016, I graduated with both High School Credentials and a Certificate of Digital Media.</p><p>After graduating High School I took the normal route of applying for colleges. Landing on my local community college as the best option. While attending my first year in 2017, I was introduced to Web Development. Shortly thereafter, I was “hooked”.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Goals for 2020:</h2><p></p><p>I believe that having accountability is the best thing you can do; Which is why I'm displaying all of my goals and progress for the year 2020.</p><ul><li><p>Write 3 Tutorials</p></li><li><p>Allow McKnight Digital public access — <strong><em>Update, Live for Public access.</em></strong></p></li><li><p>Read 5 books — <strong><em>Update: Read, 2/5</em></strong></p></li><li><p>Begin advanced Cybersecurity concepts</p></li><li><p>Put Linux (Kali or Debian) on a Chromebook — <strong><em>Update, Purchased Chromebook</em></strong></p></li></ul><p></p>",
